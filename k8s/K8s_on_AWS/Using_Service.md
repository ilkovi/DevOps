

Service could be of type:

ClusterIP
NodePort
LoadBalancer


#### Setting the Environment

1. Create AWS EC2 instance from Amazon

ssh -i "docker.pem" ec2-user@107.23.131.161

2. Create a CoreOS AWS CloudFormation for a Kubernetes cluster. Add an A record for the cluster
controller instance to the public DNS name for the CloudFormation and SSH log in to the controller
instance:

ssh -i "kubernetes-coreos.pem" core@52.203.239.87

3. Install kubectl binaries and list the nodes:



#### Creating a ClusterIP Service

./kubectl run hello-world --image=tutum/hello-world --replicas=3 --port=80

./kubectl get deployments

./kubectl get pods

./kubectl expose deployment hello-world --port=80 --type=ClusterIP

./kubectl get services

./kubectl describe svc hello-world



To invoke the service in a web browser:
1. set port forwarding from a local machine.
2. Copy the keypair used to access the cluster controller instance to the KUBERNETES MASTER:

Local_MACHINE@root$ scp -i docker.pem ec2-user@EC2_INSTANCE:~/kubernetes-coreos.pem ~/kubernetes-coreos.pem

2. Then set port forwarding
 from the KUBERNETES MASTER locahost:80
 to the cluster IP of the service on the controller instance:

Local_MACHINE@root$ ssh -i kubernetes-coreos.pem -f -nNT -L 80:10.3.0.234:80 core@KUBERNETES MASTER


Port forwarding from local machine localhost:80 to cluster-ip:80 is set. Invoke the service in a web
browser at http://localhost,





#### Creating a NodePort Service

1. Delete the service

./kubectl delete svc hello-world

2. Then expose the deployment hello-world as a service of type NodePort

./kubectl expose rc hello-world --port=80 --type=NodePort


To invoke the service in a web browser, we donâ€™t need to set port forwarding.
Obtain the public DNS name of the node at which to invoke the service as shown in Figure

Invoke the service in a web browser at URL http://public-dns:32624

Similarly, obtain the public-dns for another worker node. Invoke the service at
http://public-dns:node-port









#### Creating a LoadBalancer Service

1. Delete the serice

2. Create the service by exposing it of type LoadBalancer

./kubectl expose deployment hello-world --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer


The service is exposed as:
ClusterIP
NodePort
ExternalIP . Get it :

Obtain the external IP, the LoadBalancer Ingress, at which the service is exposed with the following
command:

./kubectl describe services hello-world | grep "LoadBalancer Ingress"



NOTE:
An AWS load balancer is created for a service of type LoadBalancer. T
he LoadBalancer Ingress is the public DNS of the load balancer, as shown in the EC2 Console
